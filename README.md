# The Mini-Blog

**Description:**

This is my first app made with Django following a tutorial on Youtube. This teaches how to interact with the database (full CRUD), User Authentication, Password Reset using GMail and other things. All this by creating a Mini Blog.

## Run

If you want to run this project on a local machine, follow these steps:

1. Create a Virtual Enviroment. (*)
2. Use the **requirements.txt** file to install all packages and their dependencies locally in case you desire to create a Virtual Environment.
3. Inside the Virtual Enviroment create migrations. &nbsp; `python manage.py makemigrations`
4. Then, Inside the Virtual Enviroment run migrations. &nbsp; `python manage.py migrate`
5. Inside the Virtual Enviroment run the Django Server. &nbsp; `python manage.py runserver`

(*) It is recommended to avoid conflicts with other packages and different versions.

*NOTE: Use the **check_setup.py** file to check if you have any of these packages already installed in case you donâ€™t want to create a Virtual Environment.*
